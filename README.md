I’m a Creative problem-solver with a unique blend of technical expertise and real-world experience. From building seamless user experiences as a developer to producing and performing music on stage, I bring a people-focused and detail-oriented approach to everything I do. My passion lies in creating innovative, scalable software that solves real-world problems while delivering a polished and intuitive experience. My journey into technology began as a professional musician and audio engineer, where I honed my technical skills through complex audio production workflows  and live performance setups. Transitioning into software development, I’ve applied my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to adapt under pressure to designing and developing scalable, user-focused applications. With a  perspective that bridges artistic sensibility and technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments where innovation and technology intersect.
