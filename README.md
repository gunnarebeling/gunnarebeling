I am a dedicated Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, problem-solving, and a passion for building innovative applications. My
journey into technology began as a professional musician and audio engineer, where I honed my technical skills through complex audio production and live
performance setups. Transitioning into software development, I’ve applied my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to adapt under pressure to designing and
developing scalable, user-focused applications. With a unique perspective that combines artistic sensibility with technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative
environments where creativity meets technology.
